        <td>AThe Time Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe,
            representing the element of time. It was contained inside the Eye of Agamotto and placed under the
            protection of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. In 2017, Doctor Strange took possession of the Stone and used
            it to defeat Dormammu.
            The following year, during the Infinity War, Doctor Strange relinquished the Stone to Thanos in exchange for
            sparing Iron Man's life. Thanos would use the Time Stone during the Battle of Wakanda to resurrect Vision
            after he was killed by Wanda Maximoff, in order to acquire the Mind Stone. Following the Snap, Thanos
            destroyed the Time Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones to prevent his work being undone
