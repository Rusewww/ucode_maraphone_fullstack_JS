<h2><a id = "header_one"></a> What makes a superhero?</h2>
<p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
    So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could
    possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be
    considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or
    detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it
    becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t
    accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero. </p>
